The objectives are:

● Create one git repository (Bitbucket or Github) to include all the following. (Github)

● 20%: Create a Kubernetes Cluster using infrastructure as code, you will get 5% only if
K8S cluster was created manually. (Terraform)

● Deploy the stateless application, which contains two containers: (Deployment: 1 pod, 2 containers)
	○ 15%: Sidecar (reverse proxy), using nginx, openresty or ESP. we usually do that
	  for auth and/or API monitoring, ex: collecting http status, however, for this
	  assignment you can use the sidecar as a reverse proxy only. 
	  (NGINX - https://medium.com/@santhoz/nginx-sidecar-reverse-proxy-for-performance-http-to-https-redirection-in-kubernetes-dd9dbe2fd0c7)
	○ 10%: Application (Sample API). 
	  (Golang)

● 15%: Deploy a stateful application which contains one container (ex: DB)  
(StatefulSet - PostgreSQL)

● 10%: Create an ingress for the stateless application, to access it from outside the cluster. 
(NGINX Controller - https://cloud.google.com/community/tutorials/nginx-ingress-gke)

● 20%: Create an auto-scaling for the stateless application. 
(Horizontal Pod AutoScaling - https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale-walkthrough/)

● 10%: Create a document (README) describing your solution detailed enough in order to
reproduce it and test the API with a simple curl command. (Markdown)
